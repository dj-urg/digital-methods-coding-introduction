# Step-by-Step Manual for Installing VS Code and Python

## Step 1: Install Python

### Download Python:
- Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- The website should automatically suggest the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Click the **"Download Python [version number]"** button.

### Run the Installer:
- Once the installer is downloaded, locate the file and open it.
- **Important:** On the first screen of the installer, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This step is crucial for ensuring that Python works correctly with VS Code.

### Install Python:
- Click on **"Install Now"** to start the installation process.
- Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes.
- After the installation is complete, you can click **"Close"**.

### Verify Python Installation:
- Open a terminal or command prompt:
  - **Windows:** Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
  - **macOS/Linux:** Open the Terminal application.
- Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
- You should see the installed Python version number (e.g., Python 3.11.x). This confirms that Python is installed and correctly added to your system's PATH.

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

### Download VS Code:
- Go to the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click the **"Download for [Your OS]"** button. The website should automatically detect your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Run the Installer:
- Once the VS Code installer is downloaded, locate the file and open it.
- Follow the installation prompts:
  - **Windows:**
    - Accept the license agreement.
    - Choose the installation location (or use the default).
    - **Important:** Check the box that says **"Add to PATH"** and any other options like "Create a desktop icon" if desired.
    - Click **"Install"**.
  - **macOS/Linux:** Drag the VS Code icon to the Applications folder or follow the on-screen instructions.

### Launch VS Code:
- Once the installation is complete, launch VS Code:
  - **Windows:** You can open it from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
  - **macOS:** Open it from the Applications folder or search for it using Spotlight.
  - **Linux:** Launch it from your applications menu or by typing `code` in the terminal.

## Step 3: Setting Up Python in VS Code

### Install Python Extension in VS Code:
- When you first open VS Code, you may be prompted to install recommended extensions. If the Python extension is suggested, click **"Install"**.
- If not, you can manually install it:
  - Click on the **Extensions** view icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
  - In the search box, type "Python" and look for the extension by Microsoft.
  - Click **"Install"**.

### Verify Python Extension Installation:
- Open a new file by clicking **File > New File**.
- Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `test.py`).
- VS Code should automatically detect Python and display a prompt to select a Python interpreter. If it doesn't, click on the Python version displayed in the bottom-left corner and select the installed Python interpreter.

### Run a Python Script in VS Code:
- Type the following code in your `test.py` file:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
- Right-click in the editor and select **"Run Python File in Terminal"**.
- The output `"Hello, World!"` should appear in the terminal at the bottom of the VS Code window. This confirms that everything is set up correctly.

## Step 4: Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks (Optional, Recommended)

### Install Jupyter Extension:
- Open the Extensions view again (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
- Search for "Jupyter" and install the Jupyter extension by Microsoft.

### Creating and Running a Jupyter Notebook:
- In VS Code, go to **File > New File** and save the file with a `.ipynb` extension (e.g., `notebook.ipynb`).
- This will create a new Jupyter Notebook. You can now write and execute Python code in separate cells.

# Step 5: Explore and Customize VS Code (Optional)

### Practical VS Code Extensions for Beginners

VS Code's flexibility and extensibility come from its vast library of extensions. Here are some recommended extensions to enhance your coding experience:

- **Python**: Essential for any Python development. This extension provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and more.

- **Jupyter**: If you're working with Jupyter Notebooks, this extension allows you to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code.

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that helps enforce consistent style across your codebase. It automatically formats your code on save, ensuring it adheres to best practices.

- **Live Server**: Launch a local development server with a live reload feature for static and dynamic pages. This is incredibly useful for web development, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you code.

- **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: This extension highlights matching brackets with different colors, making it easier to navigate complex code, especially when dealing with nested structures.

- **GitLens**: Enhances the Git capabilities built into VS Code. It allows you to visualize code changes, see who made what changes, and explore the history of your files. It's an excellent tool for learning and managing version control.

- **Python Docstring Generator**: Automatically generates docstrings for your Python functions and methods according to your preferred style (e.g., Google, Sphinx). This is particularly useful for writing clean, well-documented code.

- **Markdown All in One**: Provides comprehensive support for Markdown files, including shortcuts for formatting, table of contents generation, and more. It's a simpler alternative to Markdown Preview Enhanced, making it easier for beginners to work with Markdown documents.


To install these extensions:
1. Click on the **Extensions** view icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for the extension by name.
3. Click **Install**.

### Customize Settings

VS Code allows you to customize nearly every aspect of your development environment. Here are some common customizations:

- **Themes**: Change the look and feel of VS Code by installing themes.
  - Go to **File > Preferences > Color Theme** (or `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+T`) and choose from the default themes or search for more in the Extensions view.
  - Popular themes include **One Dark Pro**, **Dracula Official**, and **Solarized Dark**.

- **Font and Font Size**: Adjust the font family and size to your preference.
  - Go to **File > Preferences > Settings** (or `Ctrl+,`) and search for "Font".
  - Change the `"Editor: Font Family"` and `"Editor: Font Size"` settings.

- **Key Bindings**: Customize or add new key bindings.
  - Go to **File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts** (or `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S`).
  - You can search for specific commands and assign them to your preferred key combinations.

- **Auto-Save**: Enable auto-saving of files as you work.
  - Go to **File > Auto Save** and choose the delay interval or trigger (e.g., "afterDelay" or "onWindowChange").

- **Integrated Terminal Customization**: Customize the look of the integrated terminal (e.g., shell, colors).
  - Go to **File > Preferences > Settings** and search for "Terminal".
  - You can change the `"Terminal > Integrated: Shell"` setting to specify which shell to use (e.g., Bash, PowerShell).

### Explore Git and Version Control

If youâ€™re working on projects that involve version control, VS Code has built-in Git support:

- **Clone a Repository**:
  - Go to **View > Command Palette** (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
  - Type `Git: Clone` and enter the repository URL.
  - Choose a local directory where the repository will be cloned.

- **Source Control View**:
  - Click the Source Control icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
  - You can stage, commit, and push changes directly from VS Code.
  - View the changes made to your files by clicking on them in the Source Control view.

- **Git Graph Extension** (Optional):
  - Install the **Git Graph** extension to visualize your repository's history in a graph view.
  - Once installed, access it via the Command Palette or the Source Control view.

### Customize and Use Workspaces

Workspaces in VS Code allow you to manage multiple projects or folders as a single unit:

- **Create a Workspace**:
  - Open multiple folders in VS Code.
  - Go to **File > Save Workspace As...** and save your workspace file.
  - You can now open this workspace file to quickly access all your projects.

- **Settings Per Workspace**:
  - Each workspace can have its own settings.
  - Go to **File > Preferences > Settings** and choose **Workspace Settings** to customize the environment for that specific workspace.
